## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant red (#E53935), symbolizing energy and the appetizing nature of burgers. The choice of red is based on the desire to capture the spirit of the American diner.
- Background color: black(#191919) creates a welcoming and bright background that keeps the emphasis on the food images.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFEB3B) used sparingly for interactive elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a sans-serif font offering modern and warmth aesthetics to maintain the app’s contemporary feel.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif font providing the web app with a computerized and scientific vibe to enhance readability and create visual contrast.
- Use simple, outline-style icons to represent categories and actions throughout the app.
- Subtle transitions and animations on button hover states and when adding items to the cart to enhance user experience.
